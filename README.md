# Vibration-Measurement-of-Any-Surfaces-by-Using-Optical-Fiber-System

## Introduction
- The measurement of vibrations is a crucial topic. Some vibrations are necessary for the proper operation of devices (e.g., shakers, ultrasonic cleaning baths, rock drills), while others are merely undesirable side effects of manufacturing tolerances or the structure's response to external forces. As a result, we looked into the literature and found that there are a variety of methods for detecting the frequency and amplitude of vibrations using mechanical, electrical, and optical sensors [1, 4]. Regardless of the operating principle, these systems can be divided into two groups depending on whether physical contact with the vibrating item is required. As a result, we chose the option that does not require physical contact with the vibrating item.
## SolidWorks
In order to illustrate our design in real world, we have been used SolidWorks to visualize the real system. The used components in the system, IR (Infrared Led), Op-Amp, concave lens, fiber optic cable, mirror, photodiode (BPW41N) and ESP32. The software used for the system, Matlab, Arduino IDE, Proteus 8 Professional, Spyder(anoconda3) and SolidWorks2021

We collected the dispersed IR Led with the help of thin-sided lens, our light source from infrared led. We collect our led light with the fiber optic cable that we place at the focal point of our thin-sided lens. Our light, which we carry with a fiber optic cable, is transmitted to the mirror. It is transmitted to our other fiber optic cable with the vibration angle of the mirror. The output of this fiber optic cable falls on our photo diode. Thus, we take measurements depending on the amount of light falling on our photodiode.

It is the d1 length between our IR Led and our Lens. Here, we detect the rays emitted to the environment so that they come onto our Lens. With the thin-edged lens, the rays that will come out of our lens are transferred to our fiber optic cable when they come to the d2 focal point. Our light coming out of our fiber optic cable hits our mirror in the distance d3 and is refracted depending on the amount of vibration and comes to our other fiber optic cable. Our light, which we receive with our other fiber cable in the distance d4, drops a certain amount of light on the photodiode at a distance of d5. Thus, in line with the results from our equations, we measure the amount of vibration in the system as a result of the voltages created by the falling light on our photodiode.
## Circuit
Small signal amplifier is designed for this task. Current generated by photodiode is fed into base of bjt and bjt operates as an amplifier. Output of BJT is then gets read by ESP32.
