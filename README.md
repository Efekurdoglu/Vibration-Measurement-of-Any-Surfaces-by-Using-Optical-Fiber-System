# Vibration-Measurement-of-Any-Surfaces-by-Using-Optical-Fiber-System

## Introduction
The measurement of vibrations is a crucial topic. Some vibrations are necessary for the proper operation of devices (e.g., shakers, ultrasonic cleaning baths, rock drills), while others are merely undesirable side effects of manufacturing tolerances or the structure's response to external forces. As a result, we looked into the literature and found that there are a variety of methods for detecting the frequency and amplitude of vibrations using mechanical, electrical, and optical sensors [1, 4]. Regardless of the operating principle, these systems can be divided into two groups depending on whether physical contact with the vibrating item is required. As a result, we chose the option that does not require physical contact with the vibrating item.
## SolidWorks
In order to illustrate our design in real world, we have been used SolidWorks to visualize the real system. The used components in the system, IR (Infrared Led), Op-Amp, concave lens, fiber optic cable, mirror, photodiode (BPW41N) and ESP32. The software used for the system, Matlab, Arduino IDE, Proteus 8 Professional, Spyder(anoconda3) and SolidWorks2021
